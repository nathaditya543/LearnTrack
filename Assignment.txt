Brief
1. Project Summary
LearnTrack is a console-based Student & Course Management System built using Core Java.
It will allow admins to manage:

Students


Courses


Enrollments


The goal is to practice:

Java basics (variables, data types, control flow)


Classes, objects, constructors


Static vs instance members


OOP principles (encapsulation, basic inheritance, polymorphism)


Collections (ArrayList)


Basic exception handling


Clean, readable code and modular design


This project is intentionally kept focused on fundamentals without advanced topics like concurrency, streams, or heavy design patterns. Those can be added later as the cohort progresses.




2. Learning Objectives
By completing LearnTrack, mentees should be comfortable with:

Java setup & compilation


Using JDK, understanding JDK vs JRE vs JVM at a basic level


Compiling and running Java files via IDE and/or terminal


Core Java Syntax & Basics


Packages, classes, main method


Data types (primitives vs reference types)


Variables and their scopes (local, instance, static)


Typecasting basics


OOP Fundamentals


Creating classes and objects


Constructors (default, parameterized, constructor overloading)


Encapsulation using private fields + getters/setters


Basic inheritance and method overriding


Simple polymorphism examples


Logic & Control Flow


if/else, switch, loops (for, while, do-while)


Using conditions and loops in menu-driven console applications


Collections


Array vs ArrayList (why ArrayList is preferred for dynamic data)


Storing and retrieving objects using ArrayList


Exception Handling (Basic)


try-catch blocks


Handling invalid input, e.g., wrong menu option, empty lists


Clean Code Mindset


Small functions


Clear method names


Separation of concerns (entity vs service vs UI)




3. Project Requirements & Suggested Marks Breakdown (Total 100)
A. Environment Setup & JVM Understanding (10 marks)
Install and configure Java (JDK).


Create a file: docs/Setup_Instructions.md with:


JDK version used


Screenshots or brief explanation of “Hello World” program run.


Create docs/JVM_Basics.md explaining in simple language:


What is JDK, JRE, JVM


What is bytecode


What does “write once, run anywhere” mean (1–2 short paragraphs)




B. Package Structure & Basics (10 marks)
Base package (example):

com.airtribe.learntrack



Recommended sub-packages:

entity – Student, Course, Enrollment


service – StudentService, CourseService, EnrollmentService


ui – Menu / Console UI (Main.java)


exception – Custom exceptions (e.g., EntityNotFoundException, InvalidInputException)


util – Simple helper classes (e.g., IdGenerator, InputValidator)


docs – Documentation files


You must demonstrate:

Proper use of packages


public, private, and default access where appropriate


Use of static variables/methods where it makes sense (e.g., ID counters)




C. Core OOP Implementation (40 marks)
1. Entities & Encapsulation (15 marks)
Create these core entity classes:

Student


Fields: id, firstName, lastName, email, batch, active (boolean)


Course


Fields: id, courseName, description, durationInWeeks, active


Enrollment


Fields: id, studentId, courseId, enrollmentDate, status (e.g., "ACTIVE", "COMPLETED", "CANCELLED" as String or simple enum if you want slightly advanced)


Requirements:

Use private fields + public getters/setters (Encapsulation)


Add parameterized constructors (and default constructor if needed)


Demonstrate constructor overloading in at least one class (e.g., Student with and without email)


2. Inheritance & Basic Polymorphism (10 marks)
Introduce a small hierarchy to practice:

Person (base class)


Fields: id, firstName, lastName, email


Student extends Person


Optionally, introduce Trainer extends Person (even if not used much) to show inheritance


Show:

Use of super in constructors


Simple method overriding, e.g., getDisplayName() in Person and specialized behavior in Student or Trainer


3. Static, Methods, and Utility Classes (15 marks)
Use a IdGenerator utility:


Static field like private static int studentIdCounter


Static methods like getNextStudentId(), getNextCourseId()


Create meaningful methods:


In services: addStudent, removeStudent, updateStudent, listStudents


Use methods with different parameters (overloading example).


D. Application Logic & Menu-Driven Console UI (25 marks)
The core of the project is a menu-based console application in Main.java:

Example features:

Student Management


Add new student


View all students


Search student by ID


Deactivate a student (set active = false instead of deleting)


Course Management


Add new course


View all courses


Activate/Deactivate a course


Enrollment Management


Enroll a student in a course


View enrollments for a student


Mark enrollment as completed/cancelled


Implementation expectations:

Use ArrayList to store Students, Courses, and Enrollments.


All data can be in-memory only (no file DB needed for now).


Use loops and conditionals to show and process menu options.


Handle invalid input gracefully:


Option not found


Non-existent student/course IDs


Keep logic in service classes, and keep Main focused on:


Displaying menu


Reading input


Calling service methods




E. Basic Exception Handling (10 marks)
Create at least one custom exception, for example:


EntityNotFoundException when a Student or Course is not found.


Use try-catch around input parsing (e.g., converting String to int) and menu operations.


Show a clean user message instead of crashing the program.







F. Documentation & Clean Code (5 marks)
README.md with:


Project description


How to compile and run


docs/Design_Notes.md answering:


Why you used ArrayList instead of array


Where you used static members and why


Where you used inheritance and what you gained from it


Follow simple Clean Code ideas:


Methods not too long


Meaningful names (addStudent, findCourseById, not fun1 or doWork)
